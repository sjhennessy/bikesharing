# Bikesharing Analysis

## Purpose:
The purpose of this bikesharing analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. In order to solidify the proposal, seven visualizations were created to show the times/dates when bikes are most used and a breakdown of citibike users.

## Results:

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)
Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)

Two additional visualizations were included in the analysis to further demonstrate that the bike-sharing program is a smart business decision for Des Moines. The two visualizations show 1) Bike Repairs (How many trips per bike) and 2) Bike Utilization (Duration of trips per bike) to allow investors to understand the maintenance side of the business and start to calculate the number of repairs and cost to maintain the citibike program.
