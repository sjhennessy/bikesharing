# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview:
The purpose of this bikesharing analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. In order to solidify the proposal, seven visualizations were created to show the times/dates when bikes are most used and a breakdown of citibike users.

## Results:

There are seven visualizations for the Citibike analysis contained in two stories on Tableau Public. 

### Story 1 - 5 Visualizations

The five visualizations for the investors to view are: 1) Checkout Time for Users, 2) Checkout Time by Gender, 3) Trips by Weekday, 4) Trips by Gender, and 5) User Trips by Gender.

#### 
##### 
1. The checkout time graph shows 5 hours being the highest frequency of time usage for riders. The range between 4-8 hours is the most typical time usage. This was very valuable to the Des Moines investors because they initially thought usage was typically only a few hours for a user, not the longer lengths that were shown in the graph.

#####
2. The checkout times by gender show similar curves for male and females. However, the curve is much flatter for users that don't give a gender when renting a bike. Additionally, the gender is important when determining usage as there is a much greater percentage of males using the bikes versus females and users without gender input.

#####
3. The peak hours of usage during the weekdays are 7-9am and 5-7pm, while the peak hours on Saturday and Sundays are 11-4pm. The Des Moines investors were anticipating this type of usage and no suprises were contained in this visualization. 

#####
4. The pattern described in visualization 3 are consistent when broken down by male, female, and no gender listed. For any of the groups, the peak hours of usage during the weekdays are 7-9am and 5-7pm, while the peak hours on Saturday and Sundays are 11-4pm.

#####
5. This visualization shows results for subscriber and non-subscriber users. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday are the peak days for all users with Saturday being the next busiest day. Also, the majority of users are subscribers and Des Moines should market the program to secure and incentivize subscribers.

### Story 2 - 2 Visualizations

Two additional visualizations were included in the analysis to further demonstrate that the bike-sharing program is a smart business decision for Des Moines. The two visualizations show 1) Bike Repairs (how many trips per bike) and 2) Bike Utilization (duration of trips per bike) to allow investors to understand the maintenance side of the business.

####
1. The Bike Repair visualization shows the most used bikes in the upper left corner of the graph and the least used bikes in the lower right corner. The information is valuable to know the bikes that will need repair in the upcoming year.

2. The Bike Utilization visualization is a circle graph with the largest circles representing the bikes with the largest amount of usage in minutes. The data will be used in conjunction with the Bike Repair visualization to understand rental frequency and duration for each bike. 

## Summary:

The Citibike program is a smart business decision for Des Moines because of the deep understanding of the checkout times, peak hours, and type of user. Two additional visualizations are suggested for additional analysis to further understand the cost of repairs and maintainance of the citibike program. Looking deeper into Story 2, two thresholds should be determined: the number of minutes of usage that will trigger a maintenance ticket and the number of trips that will trigger a maintenance ticket. Then the number of bikes that need maintenance could be determined with the data in Story 2. That number would then be multiplied by the cost to maintain and added to the budget for Des Moines Citibike program.
